To dispel any misinformation that has been floating around: We will be meeting on Mondays throughout the year. We will always announce in advance if there will be a meeting on any given week. Generally, we don’t default to meeting every single week. We’re looking forward to a fantastic year! See you at the information meeting!!!"
